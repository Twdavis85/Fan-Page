    <h2><strong>The Story</strong></h2>
<p>
   My wife is a big Logic fan. The first thing she did when we found out we were moving to Charlotte was buy tickets to the Logic concert. 
   I had heard of Logic at the time but couldn’t name a single song by him.  The concert was on a Tuesday and I had to work at 5:00 a.m. 
   the next day so I wasn’t as excited as she was for this concert.
</p>
<p>
    When we got to concert the opening acts came out and I was entertained but the thought of having to wake up at 4:00 a.m. was still lingering 
    in the back of my head. That all changed when Logic took the stage, I was hooked from the first song. The thought of having to get up early 
    didn’t cross my mind again in fact I would have stayed up all night and went straight to work from there if I could.
</p>
<p>
    After that night I downloaded every Logic album and listened to them on repeat for the next month. I download his new albums as soon as they 
    are available, so my Logic catalog has grown since that night. We went to his concert the next time he toured and this time we were both excited 
    about it. We would have gone the next year too, but he didn’t tour in 2020 for obvious reasons.
